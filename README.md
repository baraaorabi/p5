Note that the code here can be updated at any time without any notice. 


-- vsfs.c: You will write your code here. 
-- vsfs.h: You should not need to modify this file. This is the interface of the library. Do not change function prototypes defined here. 
-- app.c: A sample test application. You can write similar applications. We will write our own applications/test-programs. 
-- makedisk.c: This is a program that you can use to create a virtual disk (i.e., a Linux file that of a given size that will act as the storage that your FS will manage and store files). 
-- formatdisk.c: This is a program that you can use to format the virtual disk it your file system. Normally, you will not need to modify this C file. You will write a vsfs_format() function in your library.
